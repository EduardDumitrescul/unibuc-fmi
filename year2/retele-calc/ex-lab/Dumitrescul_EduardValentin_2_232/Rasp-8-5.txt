Part 1: Examine Network Requirements
In this part, you will examine the network requirements to develop a VLSM address scheme for the network that is displayed in the topology diagram using the 192.168.33.128/25 network address.

Step 1: Determine how many host addresses and subnets are available.
Questions:
How many host addresses are available in a /25 network?
- 126
What is the total number of host addresses needed in the topology diagram?
- 80 (=40 + 2 + 25 + 5 + 4 + 4)
How many subnets are needed in the network topology?
- 6
Step 2: Determine the largest subnet.
Questions:
What is the subnet description (e.g. BR1 LAN or BR1-BR2 link)?
- BR1 LAN
How many IP addresses are required in the largest subnet?
- 40
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
- 255.255.255.192
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
- 62
Can you subnet the 192.168.33.128/25 network address to support this subnet?
- da
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
- 192.168.33.128/26 si 192.168.33.192/26
Use the first network address for this subnet.

Step 3: Determine the second largest subnet.
Questions:
What is the subnet description?
- BR2 LAN
How many IP addresses are required for the second largest subnet?
- 25
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
- 255.255.255.224
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
- 30
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
- da
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
- 192.168.33.192/27 si 192.168.33.224/27
Use the first network address for this subnet.

Step 4: Determine the third largest subnet.
Questions:
What is the subnet description?
- BR2 IoT LAN
How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
- 5
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
- 255.255.255.248
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
- 6
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
- da
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
- 192.168.33.224/29, 192.168.33.232/29, 192.168.33.240/29, 192.168.33.248/29
Use the first network address for this subnet.

Use the second network address for the CCTV LAN.

Use the third network address for the HVAC C2 LAN.

Step 5: Determine the fourth largest subnet.
Questions:
What is the subnet description?
- BR1-BR2 Link
How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
- 2
What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
- 255.255.255.252
How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
- 2
Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
- da
What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
- 192.168.33.248/30, 192.268.33.252/30
Use the first network address for this subnet.

Part 2: Design the VLSM Address Scheme
In this part, you will document the VLSM addressing scheme.

Step 1: Calculate the subnet information.
Use the information that you obtained in Part 1 to fill in the following table.

Subnet -Hosts - Network Adress - BroadCast Address
BR1 LAN - 40 - 192.168.33.128/25 - 192.168.33.191/25
BR2 LAN - 25 - 192.168.33.192/27 - 192.168.33.223/27
BR2 IoT LAN - 5 - 192.168.33.224/29 - 192.168.33.231/29
BR2 CCTV LAN - 4 - 192.168.33.232/29 - 192.168.33.239/29
BR2 HVAC C2LAN - 4 - 192.168.33.240/29 - 192.168.33.247/29
BR1-BR2 Link - 2 - 192.168.33.248/30 - 192.168.33.251/29


Step 2: Complete the device interface address table.
Assign the first host address in the subnet to the Ethernet interfaces. BR1 should be assigned the first host address in the BR1-BR2 Link.

BR1 G0/0/0 - 192.168.33.249/30 
BR1 G0/0/1 - 192.168.33.129/26
BR2 G0/0/0 - 192.168.33.250/30
BR2 G0/0/1 - 192.168.33.193/27
