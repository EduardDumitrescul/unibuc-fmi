Part 1: Examine Local IP Addressing Information
In this part, you will examine the IP addressing information in your home network.

Step 1: What is my IPv4 address?

c.     Repeat this step on your own device. What is the IPv4 address and default gateway for your device?
- 192.168.1.128

Step 2: What is the IPv4 address for my router?

What is the IPv4 address for your router?
 - 192.168.1.1

Step 3: What is my public IPv4 address?


d.     On your device, use one of the "what is my ip" websites you found in your search. List your public IPv4 address, location, and ISP.
- ip: 188.26.8.50
- locatie: Voluntari, IF RO
- ISP: RCS & RDS Residential CGN
 

Step 4: Examine the connections in your network.
a.     What does the connection look like between your device and your router? Is it wired or wireless?
- cablu

b.     Where is the router that your device uses to access the internet?
- pe raftul din spatele biroului
c.     What does the connection look like between your router and the internet? Does it use a cable from the cable company or the phone company? Is it wireless? Can you find the cable as it leaves your house or see the remote tower if it is a wireless connection?
- cablu coaxial care iese din casa

e.     The second hop in your traceroute command on your device is typically your ISP's POP. What is the IP address for your ISP's POP?
- 10.30.5.113

 

Step 3: Attempt to discover the physical location of the IP address for your ISP POP.
Who owns the POP for the second router in your traceroute output? You can search the internet for "ip lookup", which will result in a list of web sites that will give you information about an IP address.

Fill in the table below with the information you discovered from your IP lookup research. You may need to visit several different lookup websites to get all the information.

2nd Hop IPv4 address:
10.30.5.113
 

ISP: RCS & RDS

City: Voluntari

Region: Ilfov

Country: Romania

 

Step 5: Investigate the local ISP network.
For the example of real traceroute output shown below, hops 2 through 9 all belong to Comcast. Recall that the real IPv4 addresses for these routers have been modified for this activity. Therefore, you cannot use them to do an IP lookup. However, you can look up the IP addresses for your own traceroute output to determine how many of hops belong to your ISP.

i.      Click the i2px-Hawaii building. In the rack are two routers. The first one belongs to I2PX and represents the 12th hop in the traceroute output. What interface is assigned to the 12th hop?
GE 0/0

Step 11: Investigate the link between Internet2 and the University of Hawaii network.
The next hop in our traceroute is:

13 87 ms 85 ms 85 ms xe-1-1-0-54-kolanut-re0.uhnet.net [205.166.205.29]

The domain name for this router indicates that it is part of the University of Hawaii network (uhnet.net). This router is located at the Honolulu Internet Exchange (HIX) in Honolulu, Hawaii, most likely located within the same IXP as the i2px.hawaii router.
