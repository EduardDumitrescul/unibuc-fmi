Title:

# Introduction

- Copernican Revolution that misidentified the sun
- Definition of terms (cognition, mind, intellect, epistemic)
- essay as a "confused mess"
  - it confuses coupling (using a tool, interdependence) with constitution (being a tool)
- Statement

# The Parity Principle: A Rhetorical Sleight of Hand

- Tetris example
- Otto\Inga example
- well chose words to hide the lack of substrace/arguments.
  - they claim that i a process acts like a mind, then it is a mind
- counter-example: neural implant 
  - who does the effort?
  - what steps constitute the process

# The Fallacy of Coupling vs Constitution
- parasitic nature of tools (tools that replace cognition often reduce the ability of cognition)
  - research on how use of AI impacts the brain
  - GPS
- Adams and Aizawa
- cognitive system vs cognitive state

# The Semantic Tax: Translation vs Thought
- Otto has to write a multi-dimensional mental belief (the address) to the notebook using a linear representation (language)
- the notebook does not store "beliefs", but dead symbols needing to be interpreted
- read Fodor (Intrinsic vs Derived Intentionality)

# Temporal Disjunction: The Speed of Self
- cognition has a temporal component (milliseconds)
- Otto's mind is interrupted by the physical need to reach for the notebook and open to the relevant page

# The Consequences (the asymmetry of fragility)
- if the notebook is the mind, than the theft/lost of the notebook is equivalent to a "brain injury"
- slippery slope (fodor) -> reach panpyschism (the world becomes the mind)
- legal/ethical stake:
    - the mind being owned by somebody else (AI server)
      - are those my thoughts?
    - the shuttind down of the servers means ridding masses of people of their minds
- a criminal justifying a crime by saying he read it in a book
  - lack of responsability

# The Real Stake
- accepting this view (what does it mean?)
  - ridding ourselves of identity, independency
  - we become the tools in this extended mind
- protect the mind as a biological, effort-based process
  - human autonomy and responsability


# Conclusion
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof
- EMT is a magician's trick
  - uses language as a weapon
- the mind is the center which makes sense of the information
  - the notebook is the prop, the brain is the stage and the mind is the play
